# Stencil Components in NextJS with Tailwind

This is a minimal example to get started, hopefully it's all clear how it links together.

## Setup

- `cd stencil-library`
- `npm i`
- `npm run build`
- `cd ../next-app`
- `npm i`
- `npm run dev`

If you change any stencil components, you must rerun `npm run build`.
